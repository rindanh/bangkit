# Machine Learning Project
## For Bangkit Academy Program

Repo for Bangkit program for collaboration with Google Colab.

This project use  ML techniques explained in the [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) with TensorFlow APIs

For this project, we are trying to predict whether someone has a potential of having heart attack disease, framing the problem as binary classification.
